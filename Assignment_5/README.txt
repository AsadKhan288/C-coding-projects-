Assignment 5:

This assignment consists of a C program, which is used to implement an associative matrix structure (2D array) indexed by a pair of strings using binary search trees 

The program:
	1. Creates a Matrix
	2. Reads the string pairs (a pair of strings, i.e. two strings per line) from the "keys.txt" file
	3. Calculates occurrences of each pair of string read using the Matrix
	4. Prints the data in the Matrix
	5. Frees all allocated memory spaces for the Matrix
	6. Terminates 


To generate the executable program: 
	-Type "make" and a executable program called "mymatrix" is created

To delete executable file and additionally generated files:
	-Type "make clean" and the files will be deleted
